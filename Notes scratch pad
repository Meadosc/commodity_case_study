scratch pad



I want to take a commodity and see how many instances of said commodity occur.
Pretty easy, just
	- There's a pandas function for that! df.value_counts



Then plot the prices of each commodity over time. See if anything weird shows up.
	- This is a nice building block to do further analysis. Maybe find which has the highest instance of rate of change, or the most stable good over time? These are all just facts, so an interpretation has to come later. But you could rate them on stability and see which goods are stable and which aren't.
